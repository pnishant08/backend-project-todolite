!...Backend Project Todolite...!


Overview...

This project is a backend implementation for a lightweight todo application. It serves as a foundation where you can also connect the frontend, creating a full-stack application. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with additional tools for development.

Features...

Node.js: Used as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side.
Express: A web application framework for Node.js, used for routing and handling HTTP requests.
Nodemon: A utility that automatically restarts the server after detecting file changes, making development more efficient.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store application data.


Getting Started...

# Prerequisites
    Node.js
    npm (Node Package Manager)
    MongoDB

# Installation

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/pnishant08/backend-project-todolite.git
    cd backend-project-todolite


    Install dependencies:
    npm install


    Set up environment variables:
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add the necessary environment 
    variables. For example:
    DB_HOST=<your-mongodb-host>
    PORT=8000


    Run the server:
    npm start



This will start the server on the specified port and connect to MongoDB.

Git Issues Resolution
Problem
When attempting to push changes to the remote repository, you encountered an error indicating that the local branch was behind the remote branch. The specific error messages were:

css
Copy code
! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/pnishant08/backend-project-todolite.git'
Solution
Check Remotes:

sh
Copy code
git remote -v
Confirmed that the remote was named todo.

Pull Remote Changes:

sh
Copy code
git pull todo main --allow-unrelated-histories
This command fetched and merged the latest changes from the remote branch, resolving the "unrelated histories" issue.

Push Local Changes:

sh
Copy code
git push todo main
After resolving the merge, pushed the local changes to the remote repository successfully.
